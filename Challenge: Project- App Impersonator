Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

    CREATE a table to store the data.
    INSERT a few example rows in the table.
    Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
    Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.


CREATE TABLE authors (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    fullname TEXT, genre TEXT, nationality TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES ("Stephen King", "Horror", "American");
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES ("Colleen Hoover", "YA fiction", "American");
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES ("Nicholas Sparks", "Romantic fiction", "American");
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES ("Delia Owens","Literary fiction", "American");
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES("Ernest Hemingway","Modernist", "American");
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES("James Patterson", "Thriller", "American");
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES
("Lisa Gardner", "Thriller", "American");
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES("Clive Cussler", "Adventure", "American");
INSERT INTO authors (fullname, genre, nationality) VALUES
("Jude Deveraux", "Historical Romance", "American");

CREATE TABLE sales (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
    author_ID INTEGER, books_sold INTEGER);
INSERT INTO sales (author_ID, books_sold) VALUES( 1, 350000000);
INSERT INTO sales (author_ID, books_sold) VALUES( 2, 4000000);
